# Hello World Python Project

## Overview

This is a simple Python project containing a basic "Hello World" program. The repository demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts including function definitions, conditional execution, and console output. This serves as a starting point for Python development and can be extended with additional functionality.

## System Architecture

The project follows a simple script-based architecture:

- **Single-file application**: The entire application is contained within `hello_world.py`
- **Procedural programming**: Uses a simple function-based approach with a main entry point
- **Console-based output**: Utilizes standard output for user interaction
- **Standalone execution**: Designed to run independently without external dependencies

## Key Components

### Core Files
- `hello_world.py`: Main application file containing the program logic

### Main Functions
- `main()`: Primary function that handles the greeting output
- Entry point conditional: Ensures proper execution when run as a script

### Design Patterns
- **Entry point pattern**: Uses `if __name__ == "__main__"` for proper script execution
- **Function-based organization**: Separates logic into reusable functions
- **Documentation pattern**: Includes comprehensive docstrings and comments

## Data Flow

1. Script execution begins at the conditional check
2. `main()` function is called if running as primary script
3. Two greeting messages are printed to console output
4. Program execution completes

## External Dependencies

- **Runtime**: Python 3.x interpreter
- **Standard library**: Uses built-in `print()` function only
- **No external packages**: Project has no third-party dependencies

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Execute directly with `python hello_world.py` or `python3 hello_world.py`
- Requires Python 3.x runtime environment

### Potential Extensions
- Can be packaged as a module for import by other scripts
- Ready for containerization with Docker if needed
- Suitable for CI/CD pipeline integration

## Changelog
